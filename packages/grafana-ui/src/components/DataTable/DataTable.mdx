# DataTable

<Badge text="Alpha" icon="rocket" color="blue" tooltip="This component is still experimental." />

The DataTable is used to display and select data efficiently.
It allows for the display and modification of detailed information.
With additional functionality it allows for batch editing, as needed by your feature's users.

### When to use

The DataTable can be used to allow users to perform administrative tasks workflows.

### When not to use

Avoid using the DataTable where mobile or responsiveness may be a requirement.
Consider an alternative pattern where the user is presented with a summary list and can click/tap to an individual page for each row in that list.

### Usage

```tsx
import { DataTable } from '@grafana/ui';

const MyPage = () => {
  const data = useMyData();

  return <DataTable data={data} />;
};
```

<Props of={DataTable} />

## Examples

### With row expansion

Individual rows can be expanded to display additional details or reconfigure properties previously defined when the row was created.
The expanded row area should be used to declutter the primary presentation of data, carefully consider what the user needs to know at first glance and what can be hidden behind the Row Expander button.

In general, data-types that are consistent across all dataset are in the primary table, variances are pushed to the expanded section for each individual row.

<Story id="experimental-datatable--with-row-expansion" />

Row expansion is enabled whenever the `renderExpanded` prop is provided. The `renderExpanded` function is called with the row's data and should return a ReactNode.

```tsx
interface TableData {
  datasource: string;
  repo: string;
  description: string;
}

const tableData: TableData[] = [
  //...
];

const columns: Array<Column<TableData>> = [
  //...
];

const ExpandedCell = ({ description }: TableData) => {
  return <p>{description}</p>;
};

export const WithRowExpansion: ComponentStory<typeof DataTable> = (args) => {
  return (
    <DataTable columns={columns} data={tableData} getRowId={(r) => r.datasource} renderExpandedRow={ExpandedCell} />
  );
};
```
