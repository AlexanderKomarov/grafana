# Provision RBAC resources

Role-based access control provisioning provides a way to manage your access control setup without having to make manual changes through the UI or APIs.
You can provision custom roles as well as role assignments.

There are two options to choose from:

1. Provision your RBAC setup using Terraform.

1. Use Grafana file provisioning to provision your RBAC setup through yaml configuration files.
